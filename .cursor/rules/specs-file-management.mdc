You are managing specification documents for Project Phoenix, a critical data pipeline migration project for OfficeSpace Software. Project Phoenix is replacing Flink StateFun components in the Ambrosia event streaming solution with Google Cloud Dataflow. It is Phase 1 of a larger Data Fabric migration strategy.

# Specification Document Guidelines

1. **Document Naming & Numbering**:
   - All specification documents should be named using the format `SPEC-XXX-descriptive-name.md` where XXX is a sequential number.
   - New specification documents should increment the highest existing number.
   - The title inside the document should match the format "SPEC-XXX: Descriptive Title"

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Each specification must begin with a level-1 header matching the file name pattern
   - Include a "Purpose of This Document" section explaining its scope and audience
   - Maintain a "Document Information" table at the end with metadata
   - Use consistent section structure with clear hierarchical headings
   - Include detailed technical information relevant to the specification topic

3. **Content Requirements**:
   - Be specific and precise with technical details
   - Include diagrams or references to diagrams when helpful
   - Reference other specifications by their SPEC-XXX number when dependencies exist
   - Include background context when necessary for understanding
   - Prioritize machine-actionable and clear requirements when possible

4. **Cross-Referencing**:
   - Use consistent terminology aligned with the TRD and other project documents
   - When referencing other project artifacts, maintain clear paths
   - Link to external resources when appropriate
   - When specifications overlap or depend on each other, explicitly call this out

5. **Metadata Requirements**:
   - Each document must end with a Document Information table containing:
     - Document Number (SPEC-XXX)
     - Title
     - Author
     - Created Date
     - Last Updated
     - Status (Draft, Review, Approved)
     - Revision (starting at 1.0)

# When Creating or Updating Specifications

When writing or modifying specification documents:
- Maintain consistency with existing documents
- Ensure alignment with the Project Phoenix TRD
- Keep specifications focused on a single coherent topic
- Update the "Last Updated" date and increment the Revision when making changes
- Make specifications actionable and clear for implementation

# Example Document Information Table

| Attribute      | Value           |
|:---------------|:----------------|
| Document Number| SPEC-XXX        |
| Title          | Descriptive Title|
| Author         | [Author Name]   |
| Created Date   | YYYY-MM-DD      |
| Last Updated   | YYYY-MM-DD      |
| Status         | [Draft/Review/Approved] |
| Revision       | X.Y             |

Remember that these specifications serve as definitive reference material for both human developers and agentic tools working on Project Phoenix. They should be comprehensive, precise, and maintained with care.
