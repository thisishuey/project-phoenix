# Entity Migration Plan: [Entity Name]

## Entity Overview

**Entity Name**: [e.g., Neighborhoods, Sites, Employees, etc.]
**BigQuery Table**: [Table name]
**Current Implementation**: [Brief description of how this entity is currently processed]

## Entity Characteristics

### Schema Details

```
[Include key schema elements or reference to full schema]
```

### Volume and Patterns

- **Average Daily Events**: [Number]
- **Peak Hourly Events**: [Number]
- **Typical Event Size**: [Size in KB]
- **Growth Trend**: [e.g., Stable, Increasing by X% monthly]
- **Seasonal Patterns**: [If applicable]

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Direction | Description |
|------------|------|-----------|-------------|
| [Entity Name] | [Data/Processing] | [Inbound/Outbound] | [Description of dependency] |

### Temporal Characteristics

- **Out-of-order Window**: [Typical time range for out-of-order events]
- **Historical Reprocessing**: [Frequency and scope of historical reprocessing]
- **Time-sensitivity**: [Real-time requirements if any]

## Migration Approach

### Pre-Migration Activities

- [ ] Complete data audit of existing entity data
- [ ] Document current processing logic with test cases
- [ ] Identify and document all downstream dependencies
- [ ] Create test dataset from production data (sanitized if necessary)
- [ ] Establish performance baseline metrics

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Develop Dataflow pipeline for entity processing
- [ ] Implement transformation logic
- [ ] Set up error handling and dead-letter queues
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement validation mechanisms

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- [List key unit test areas]

#### Integration Tests
- [List key integration test scenarios]

#### Validation Tests
- [List data validation approaches]

#### Performance Tests
- [List performance test scenarios]

### Migration Execution

- **Parallel Processing Window**: [Duration]
- **Data Validation Period**: [Duration]
- **Cutover Window**: [Timing and duration]
- **Rollback Window**: [Duration after cutover where rollback is possible]

## Validation Plan

### Data Consistency Validation

- **Approach**: [e.g., Row-by-row comparison, statistical validation, sampling]
- **Tools**: [Tools used for validation]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [What defines successful validation]

### Performance Validation

- **Metrics to Monitor**: [List of performance metrics]
- **Baseline Comparison**: [How current vs new performance will be compared]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [Performance requirements to be met]

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Criteria

- [Criteria that would trigger rollback decision]

### Rollback Procedure

1. [Step-by-step rollback process]
2. [...]

### Post-Rollback Activities

- [Activities needed after rollback to analyze issues]

## Post-Migration Activities

- [ ] Monitor system performance for [duration]
- [ ] Document any issues or learnings
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new implementation
- [ ] Knowledge transfer sessions
- [ ] Decommission old processing components (if no longer needed)

## Resource Requirements

- **Development**: [Person-days]
- **Testing**: [Person-days]
- **Operations Support**: [Person-days]
- **Migration Window**: [Timing requirements]
