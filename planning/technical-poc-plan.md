# Project Phoenix: Technical Proof of Concept Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the proof of concept (POC) testing approach for validating key technical capabilities required for Project Phoenix. These POCs will inform architecture decisions and help mitigate risks before full-scale implementation.

## POC Objectives

1. Validate technical feasibility of replacing StateFun with Google Cloud Dataflow
2. Measure performance characteristics and scalability
3. Evaluate development experience and complexity
4. Assess operational monitoring capabilities
5. Test time-based processing capabilities
6. Determine appropriate architecture pattern from the three proposed paths

## POC Structure

Each POC will follow a structured approach:

1. **Definition**: Clear description of what is being tested
2. **Setup**: Technical environment and configurations
3. **Test Cases**: Specific scenarios to validate
4. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define success
5. **Evaluation**: Analysis of results against criteria
6. **Recommendation**: Guidance for implementation decisions

## Proof of Concept Areas

### POC 1: Dataflow Basic Pipeline

**Objective**: Validate basic Dataflow pipeline functionality and integration with Kafka and BigQuery

**Test Cases**:
- Simple event processing from Kafka to BigQuery
- Basic transformations and filtering
- Error handling and dead-letter queues
- Monitoring and operational visibility

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully processes events with consistent results
- Handles basic error scenarios gracefully
- Provides adequate monitoring visibility
- Deployment process is documented and repeatable

**Resources Required**:
- GCP Development Environment
- Test Kafka cluster
- BigQuery test dataset
- 1-2 developers for 1 week

### POC 2: Temporal Data Processing

**Objective**: Evaluate Dataflow's capabilities for handling complex temporal requirements

**Test Cases**:
- Processing out-of-order events (varying from minutes to months late)
- Time-based windowing and aggregations
- Event-time vs. processing-time handling
- Historical data reprocessing

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully handles events arriving out of order
- Correctly processes events based on their valid time
- Can reconcile historical corrections with existing data
- Performance remains acceptable under various temporal scenarios

**Resources Required**:
- GCP Development Environment
- Test dataset with time-varying events
- 1-2 developers for 1 week

### POC 3: XTDB Integration (Path 2 & 3)

**Objective**: Assess the feasibility and benefits of incorporating XTDB for temporal data enrichment

**Test Cases**:
- XTDB setup and configuration
- Integration with Dataflow pipeline
- Temporal query performance
- Complex event-time processing
- Data consistency and recovery

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully integrates XTDB with Dataflow
- Improves handling of complex temporal scenarios
- Provides acceptable performance for expected workloads
- Development complexity remains manageable

**Resources Required**:
- GCP Development Environment
- XTDB deployment
- 2 developers for 1-2 weeks

### POC 4: Entity Migration Prototype

**Objective**: Test end-to-end migration of a simple entity from StateFun to Dataflow

**Test Cases**:
- Complete processing of one entity type (e.g., Neighborhoods)
- Data consistency validation
- Parallel processing during migration
- Cutover procedures

**Success Criteria**:
- Entity successfully processed in new system
- Output data matches expected format and content
- Migration process is documented and repeatable
- Performance meets or exceeds current implementation

**Resources Required**:
- GCP Development Environment
- Access to current production data schemas
- 2 developers for 2 weeks

### POC 5: Scale and Performance Testing

**Objective**: Validate Dataflow's performance characteristics under expected workloads

**Test Cases**:
- High-volume event processing
- Multi-tenancy with simulated client separation
- Auto-scaling behavior
- Cost analysis under various loads

**Success Criteria**:
- Handles peak expected throughput without degradation
- Auto-scales appropriately with changing workloads
- Cost model is predictable and acceptable
- Multi-tenant isolation is maintained

**Resources Required**:
- GCP Development Environment
- Load testing tools
- Performance monitoring setup
- 1-2 developers for 1 week

## Timeline and Dependencies

| POC | Duration | Dependencies | Target Completion |
|-----|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| POC 1: Dataflow Basic Pipeline | 1 week | GCP environment setup | Sprint 11 |
| POC 2: Temporal Data Processing | 1 week | POC 1 completion | Sprint 11 |

## Decision Points

Following the completion of POCs, these key decisions will be made:

1. **Architecture Pattern Selection**:
   - Direct Streaming Pipeline (Path 1)
   - Enrichment-Based Pipeline (Path 2)
   - Dual-Pipeline Approach (Path 3)

2. **XTDB Integration Decision**:
   - Whether to incorporate XTDB for temporal processing
   - If yes, in what capacity and for which entity types

3. **Entity Migration Prioritization**:
   - Which entity to migrate first
   - Sequence and grouping of subsequent entities

4. **Performance Optimization Strategy**:
   - Necessary tuning parameters
   - Scaling configurations
   - Cost optimization approaches

## Deliverables

Each POC will produce the following deliverables:

1. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Code examples
   - Configuration details

2. **Test Results Report**:
   - Performance metrics
   - Success criteria evaluation
   - Identified limitations or issues
   - Recommendations

3. **Decision Recommendation**:
   - Specific technical approach recommendation
   - Justification based on POC results
   - Implementation considerations
