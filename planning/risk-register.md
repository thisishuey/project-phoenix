## Risk Response Process

### Triggered Risk Response

When a risk materializes:

1. **Identification**: Document the risk occurrence
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate actual impact vs. anticipated impact
3. **Response**: Implement contingency plan
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders according to communication plan
5. **Adjustment**: Update risk register and mitigation strategies

### Risk Escalation Criteria

| Risk Level | Escalation Path | Response Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| Extreme | Executive Sponsor, immediate action | Same day |
| High | Project Manager, priority action | Within 2 days |
| Medium | Risk Owner, planned action | Within 1 week |
| Low | Risk Owner, monitored response | Within 2 weeks |

## Risk Register Maintenance

This risk register will be maintained throughout the Project Phoenix lifecycle with:

1. Regular reviews and updates
2. New risk identification
3. Closed risk archiving
4. Mitigation strategy adjustments
5. Lessons learned documentation

## Risk Categorization Criteria

### Probability

- **High**: 70% or greater chance of occurrence
- **Medium**: 30% to 70% chance of occurrence
- **Low**: Less than 30% chance of occurrence

### Impact

- **High**: Significant effect on project success, timeline, budget, or quality
- **Medium**: Moderate effect that can be managed with additional resources
- **Low**: Minor effect that can be absorbed within existing parameters

### Risk Level

Determined by the intersection of Probability and Impact in the Risk Assessment Matrix.
