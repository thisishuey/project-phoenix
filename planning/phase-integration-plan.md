# Data Fabric Phase Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines how Project Phoenix (Phase 1) connects to and enables subsequent phases of OfficeSpace Software's Data Fabric migration strategy. It details the technical dependencies, handoff criteria, and shared components across all four phases.

## Data Fabric Migration Strategy

### Phase Summary

1. **Phase 1: Project Phoenix**
   - Replace Flink StateFun component with Dataflow-based solution
   - Focus on 1:1 migration of existing functionality
   - Establish technical foundation for future phases

2. **Phase 2: Streamline Data Migration**
   - Optimize and enhance data pipeline for new data types
   - Improve developer experience for adding new entities
   - Build on Project Phoenix architecture

3. **Phase 3: GraphQL API Integration**
   - Enable external systems to trigger events
   - Integrate presence events with reporting
   - Establish GraphQL as primary integration point

4. **Phase 4: Apigee Replacement**
   - Unify all API layers into a federated GraphQL API
   - Fully replace Apigee functionality
   - Complete the Data Fabric vision

## Technical Dependencies Between Phases

|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Authentication Framework | Basic auth patterns established | Security redesign |
| API Design Patterns | Consistent approach to entity APIs | Fragmented API experience |
| Service Discovery | How services locate one another | Integration complexity |
| Error Handling Standards | Consistent error responses | Inconsistent developer experience |

## Handoff Criteria

   - Streamlined process for adding new data types
   - Developer experience improvements validated
   - Documentation updated for all new components

2. **GraphQL Foundation**
   - Initial GraphQL schema design
   - Authentication patterns established
   - Initial integration points identified

### Phase 3 → Phase 4

   - Performance validated under expected load
   - Security review completed

2. **Apigee Analysis**
   - Complete inventory of Apigee functionality
   - Migration strategy documented
   - Test plan established

## Shared Components

The following components will be shared across multiple phases and should be designed with future requirements in mind:

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Relevant Phases | Design Considerations |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Kafka Cluster | All Phases | Topic organization, retention, scaling |
| Dataflow Pipeline Framework | All Phases | Modularity, reusability, monitoring |
| BigQuery Schema | All Phases | Future extensions, compatibility |
| Authentication Services | Phases 3 & 4 | Scalability, security, standards |
| Monitoring & Alerting | All Phases | Comprehensive coverage, alert management |

### Development Tooling

| Component | Relevant Phases | Design Considerations |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| CI/CD Pipeline | All Phases | Support for all components, testing |
| Testing Framework | All Phases | Unit, integration, performance testing |
| Documentation System | All Phases | Accessibility, searchability, maintenance |
| Development Environments | All Phases | Parity with production, isolation |

## Project Phoenix Design Decisions with Phase Impact

The following key Project Phoenix design decisions will have significant impact on later phases:

### Architecture Pattern Selection

| Option | Phase 2 Impact | Phase 3 Impact | Phase 4 Impact | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Direct Streaming Pipeline | Simplest to extend | May require additional components for complex temporality | Minimal impact | Consider if temporal requirements are manageable |
| Enrichment-Based Pipeline | More complex but handles temporality | Better suited for complex event processing | Minimal impact | Consider if temporal requirements are significant |
| Dual-Pipeline Approach | Most complex to extend | Best suited for mixed workloads | Minimal impact | Consider only if clearly needed for performance |

### Technology Choices

| Technology | Future Phase Considerations |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Google Cloud Dataflow | Lock-in implications, cost management strategies |
| XTDB | Operational complexity, scaling for increased workloads |
| Kafka | Topic management at scale, multi-region considerations |
| BigQuery | Schema evolution, partitioning strategies, cost optimization |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Affected Phases | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Technical debt carried forward | All | Early identification of design flaws; refactoring as needed |
| Skill gaps between phases | All | Knowledge transfer, documentation, training |
| Shifting requirements | All | Flexible architecture, regular stakeholder reviews |
| Timeline pressure reducing quality | All | Clear quality gates, automated testing |
| Integration complexity increases | 3, 4 | Early prototyping of key integration points |
