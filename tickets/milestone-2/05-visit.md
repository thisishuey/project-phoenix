# Implement Visit Management

## Description
Implement Visit Management functionality for handling visitor check-ins, check-outs, and related visitor management events in the visitor management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visit Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a visitor check-in event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the visit record should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Preregistration Management
```gherkin
Given a visitor preregistration event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the preregistration should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Check-out Processing
```gherkin
Given a visitor check-out event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the visit record should be updated
And the check-out time should be recorded
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Location Integration
```gherkin
Given a location mapping event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the visit records should be updated with the new mapping
And the state should be consistent
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Employee Integration
```gherkin
Given an employee update event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the related visit records should be updated
And the host information should be consistent
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid visit event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```

## Technical Notes
- Configure event pipeline to:
  - Process visitor lifecycle events
  - Handle preregistration management
  - Manage location and employee integration
  - Support visit state management
  - Enable monitoring and observability
  - Maintain data quality and validation
