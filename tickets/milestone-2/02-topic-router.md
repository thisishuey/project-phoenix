# Implement Beam Topic Router

## Description
Implement topic-to-topic routing using Apache Beam for event distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Event Routing
```gherkin
Given an incoming event
When it is processed by the router
Then it should be routed to the correct topic
And the event format should be preserved
```

### Router Configuration
```gherkin
Given a new event type
When it is added to the router configuration
Then it should be properly routed
And the configuration should be validated
```

## Technical Notes
- Implement Beam pipeline for routing
- Set up topic configuration
- Add event type validation
- Configure error handling
- Add monitoring for routing operations
