# Implement BigQuery Projection

## Description
Implement data projection to BigQuery for analytics and reporting purposes, ensuring reliable data transfer and proper schema management.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Projection
```gherkin
Given new data needs to be projected to BigQuery
When the projection is executed
Then the data should be properly formatted
And the projection should succeed
And the data should be queryable
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given a failed projection
When the error is handled
Then appropriate retry logic should be applied
And the error should be logged
And data consistency should be maintained
```

### Data Quality
```gherkin
Given data is projected to BigQuery
When it is stored
Then it should be validated
And it should be properly partitioned
And it should be optimized for query performance
```

## Technical Notes
- Implement projection logic
- Add retry mechanism
- Configure error handling
- Add monitoring for projection operations
- Implement data validation
- Set up partitioning strategy
- Configure query optimization
