# Implement Site Management

## Description
Implement Site Management functionality for handling site-related events, maintaining relationships with floors and employees, and tracking employee presence.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Site Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a site creation or update event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the site record should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Employee Presence
```gherkin
Given an employee presence event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the site's employee presence should be updated
And the state should be consistent
And the event should be processed in real-time
```

### Location Integration
```gherkin
Given a location mapping event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the site-location relationship should be updated
And the state should be consistent
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Configuration Management
```gherkin
Given a site configuration update
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the site configuration should be updated
And the changes should be propagated to subscribers
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid site event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```
