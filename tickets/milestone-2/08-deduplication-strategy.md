# Implement Event Deduplication Strategy

## Description
Design and implement a deduplication strategy to ensure data consistency and prevent duplicate processing in the event pipeline. The strategy should be flexible enough to accommodate different event types and processing patterns while maintaining system reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Requirements
```gherkin
Given the event pipeline
When deduplication is implemented
Then it should:
  - Prevent duplicate processing of events
  - Maintain data consistency
  - Support different event types
  - Handle out-of-order events
  - Provide clear processing guarantees
```

### Event Processing
```gherkin
Given an event enters the pipeline
When it is processed
Then it should:
  - Be uniquely identifiable
  - Be processed exactly once
  - Maintain correct ordering
  - Support idempotent operations
  - Handle processing failures gracefully
```

### System Behavior
```gherkin
Given the deduplication system
When it operates
Then it should:
  - Be configurable for different needs
  - Provide clear error handling
  - Support monitoring and metrics
  - Allow for manual intervention
  - Maintain audit capabilities
```

## Technical Notes
- The solution should be:
  - Implementation-agnostic
  - Scalable
  - Maintainable
  - Observable
  - Configurable
  - Reliable
