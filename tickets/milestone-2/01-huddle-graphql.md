# Implement Huddle GraphQL Integration

## Description
Implement GraphQL integration with Huddle for pushing visitor data and events.

## Acceptance Criteria

### GraphQL Integration
```gherkin
Given visitor data needs to be pushed to Huddle
When the GraphQL mutation is executed
Then the data should be properly formatted
And the mutation should succeed
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given a failed GraphQL mutation
When the error is handled
Then appropriate retry logic should be applied
And the error should be logged
```

## Technical Notes
- Set up GraphQL client
- Implement mutation schemas
- Add retry logic
- Configure error handling
- Add monitoring for GraphQL operations
