# Complete Performance Testing

## Description
Conduct comprehensive performance testing of the new system to ensure it meets scalability and reliability requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Load Testing
```gherkin
Given the system is implemented
When load testing is performed
Then it should:
  - Handle expected peak loads
  - Maintain response times under threshold
  - Scale horizontally as needed
  - Recover from high load gracefully
```

### Stress Testing
```gherkin
Given the system is under stress
When testing is performed
Then it should:
  - Handle unexpected load spikes
  - Maintain data consistency
  - Provide appropriate error responses
  - Recover automatically when possible
```

### Endurance Testing
```gherkin
Given the system is running continuously
When endurance testing is performed
Then it should:
  - Maintain performance over time
  - Handle memory usage appropriately
  - Maintain data integrity
  - Show no degradation in service
```

## Technical Notes
- Testing should include:
  - Automated test suites
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Resource utilization monitoring
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Scalability validation
  - Recovery testing
