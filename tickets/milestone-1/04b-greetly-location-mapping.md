# Implement Greetly Location Site Mapping

## Description
Implement site mapping functionality for Greetly kiosk locations in the visitor management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Location Mapping
```gherkin
Given a location mapping event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the location-site relationship should be updated
And the state should be consistent
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Location Unmapping
```gherkin
Given a location unmapping event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the location-site relationship should be removed
And the state should be consistent
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid mapping event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```

## Technical Notes
- Configure event pipeline to:
  - Process location mapping events
  - Handle site relationship management
  - Support mapping and unmapping
  - Enable monitoring and observability
  - Maintain data quality and validation
