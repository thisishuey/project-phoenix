# Set Up Test Pipeline

## Description
Configure a lightweight test pipeline for Project Phoenix to enable rapid feedback during development.

## Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given the need for rapid development feedback
When I set up the test pipeline
Then I should be able to run quick tests without full deployment
And the pipeline should provide immediate feedback on code changes
```

## Technical Notes
- Set up lightweight test environment
- Configure quick test execution
- Implement immediate feedback mechanisms
- Document pipeline usage and configuration
