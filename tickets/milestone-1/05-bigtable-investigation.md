# Investigate BigTable for State Management

## Description
Investigate the feasibility and implementation details of using BigTable with continuous materialized views for state management in the Dataflow pipeline, comparing it with BigQuery-based solutions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Investigation
```gherkin
Given the need for state management
When BigTable is investigated
Then it should:
  - Evaluate continuous materialized views capabilities
  - Compare performance with BigQuery
  - Assess scalability characteristics
  - Review cost implications
  - Document integration requirements
```

### Solution Design
```gherkin
Given the investigation results
When a BigTable solution is designed
Then it should:
  - Define state storage schema
  - Specify materialized view configurations
  - Document performance requirements
  - Outline scaling strategy
  - Detail monitoring approach
```

### Implementation Planning
```gherkin
Given the solution design
When implementation is planned
Then it should:
  - Define integration points
  - Specify data migration strategy
  - Outline testing requirements
  - Document rollback procedures
  - Detail monitoring setup
```
