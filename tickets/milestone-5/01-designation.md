# Implement Designation Management

## Description
Implement designation management functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Designation Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a designation creation or update event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the designation record should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid designation event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```

## Technical Notes
- Configure event pipeline to:
  - Process designation lifecycle events
  - Enable monitoring and observability
  - Maintain data quality and validation
