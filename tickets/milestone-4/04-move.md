# Implement Move Management

## Description
Implement move management functionality in the visitor management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Move Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a move creation or update event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the move record should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid move event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```

## Technical Notes
- Configure event pipeline to:
  - Process move lifecycle events
  - Enable monitoring and observability
  - Maintain data quality and validation
