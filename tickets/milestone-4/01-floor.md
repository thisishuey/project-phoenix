Implement floor management functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Floor Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a floor creation or update event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the floor record should be properly stored
And the state should be updated
And the event should be processed in order
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given an invalid floor event
When it is processed by the event pipeline
Then the error should be logged
And the pipeline should continue processing other events
```

## Technical Notes
- Configure event pipeline to:
  - Process floor lifecycle events
  - Enable monitoring and observability
