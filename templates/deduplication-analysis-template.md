# Deduplication Analysis Template

## Event Structure
Please provide information about:
1. Event identification:
   - What fields uniquely identify an event?
   - Is there an event ID or correlation ID?
   - How are events timestamped?
   - What is the event schema/structure?

2. Event types:
   - What are the different types of events?
   - Do different event types have different identification requirements?
   - Are there any event type-specific processing rules?

## Current Processing
Please describe:
1. Event flow:
   - How are events currently produced?
   - What is the typical event volume and frequency?
   - What systems are consuming these events?
   - How is event ordering currently maintained?

2. Duplicate handling:
   - Are there known patterns of duplicate events?
   - How are duplicates currently detected?
   - What happens when a duplicate is detected?
   - Are there any existing deduplication mechanisms?

## State Management
Please explain:
1. State handling:
   - How is state currently maintained?
   - What is the state update mechanism?
   - How are state changes tracked?
   - What is the current state recovery process?

2. Idempotency:
   - Are there existing idempotency patterns?
   - How are out-of-order events handled?
   - What is the current retry mechanism?
   - How are failed events handled?

## Integration Points
Please detail:
1. System interactions:
   - What systems produce events?
   - What systems consume events?
   - Are there any existing retry mechanisms?
   - How are integration failures handled?

2. Error handling:
   - What is the current error handling strategy?
   - How are failed events logged?
   - What is the recovery process?
   - Are there any manual intervention points?

## Performance Requirements
Please specify:
1. Processing requirements:
   - What are the latency requirements?
   - What is the acceptable deduplication window?
   - Are there any performance bottlenecks?
   - What are the resource constraints?

2. Scaling considerations:
   - How does the system handle increased load?
   - What are the current scaling mechanisms?
   - Are there any known performance issues?
   - What are the current resource utilization patterns?

## Monitoring and Logging
Please describe:
1. Current monitoring:
   - What metrics are collected?
   - How are duplicate events logged?
   - What monitoring tools are in use?
   - What alerting mechanisms exist?

2. Observability:
   - How is system health monitored?
   - What dashboards are available?
   - How are issues detected?
   - What is the current troubleshooting process?

## Additional Considerations
Please note:
1. Any specific requirements or constraints
2. Known issues or challenges
3. Future scalability needs
4. Any other relevant information
