## 6. Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 Migration Approach

Project Phoenix will follow an entity-by-entity migration strategy, starting with simpler entities to validate the approach before moving to more complex ones.

#### Entity-by-Entity Migration Strategy

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Complete technical prototyping to validate architecture
   - Establish development environment and tooling
   - Create templates and frameworks for entity migration
   - Implement monitoring and observability infrastructure

2. **Initial Entity Migration**:
   - Select a simple entity with limited dependencies (e.g., Neighborhoods)
   - Implement complete pipeline for this entity
   - Validate data consistency and performance
   - Document patterns and lessons learned

3. **Incremental Migration**:
   - Migrate remaining entities in order of increasing complexity
   - Run parallel processing during transition periods
   - Validate each entity migration thoroughly before proceeding
   - Gradually shift traffic from old to new system

4. **Transition Completion**:
   - Finalize migration of all entity types
   - Complete validation across all entities
   - Decommission old StateFun components
   - Document final architecture and operational procedures

#### Entity Prioritization Framework

The following criteria will be used to prioritize entity migration:

1. **Complexity**: Start with simpler entities to establish patterns
2. **Dependencies**: Prioritize entities with fewer dependencies on other entities
3. **Volume**: Consider data volume and throughput requirements
4. **Business Criticality**: Balance technical factors with business importance
5. **Temporal Complexity**: Consider the complexity of temporal requirements

Preliminary entity prioritization (subject to revision based on prototyping):

1. Neighborhoods (simpler schema, fewer dependencies)
2. Sites (foundation for other entities)
3. Employees (moderate complexity)
4. Floors (depends on Sites)
5. Greetly Visits (external integration)
6. Desk Shifts (specialized temporal aspects)
7. Desk Moves (depends on Desks)
8. Presence (complex temporal requirements)
9. Desks (complex with nested structures)

#### Migration Validation Procedures

Each entity migration will include comprehensive validation:

1. **Data Consistency Validation**:
   - Compare output data between old and new systems
   - Verify field-by-field correctness
   - Validate entity relationships
   - Ensure temporal accuracy

2. **Performance Validation**:
   - Measure throughput and latency
   - Compare resource utilization
   - Validate scaling behavior
   - Test under peak load conditions

3. **Operational Validation**:
   - Verify monitoring and alerting
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Validate operational procedures
   - Ensure proper logging and traceability

#### Cutover Planning

For each entity, the cutover process will include:

1. **Pre-Cutover**:
   - Run both old and new systems in parallel
   - Validate data consistency continuously
   - Prepare rollback procedures
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Cutover Execution**:
   - Redirect event processing to new system
   - Monitor closely for issues
   - Maintain old system in standby mode
   - Validate successful processing

3. **Post-Cutover**:
   - Continue monitoring for a defined period
   - Conduct final validation
   - Document any issues and resolutions
   - Decommission old system components when appropriate
