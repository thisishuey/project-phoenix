# Revised Timeline for Project Phoenix (4-Month Schedule)

## 9.3 Timeline

### 9.3.1 Detailed Timeline for Project Phoenix

To meet the accelerated 4-month timeline, the project will adopt a more aggressive approach to entity migration, with overlapping work streams and a focus on parallel development.

| Sprint | Dates | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|--------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Sprint 1 | Week 1-2 | Architecture definition, planning, initial prototyping | TRD, Architecture Documentation, Initial Prototypes |
| Sprint 2 | Week 3-4 | Complete technical prototyping, development environment setup | Prototype Results, Architecture Decisions, Development Environment |
| Sprint 3 | Week 5-6 | First entity migration implementation, pipeline framework development | Initial Entity Pipeline, Pipeline Framework, Monitoring Setup |
| Sprint 4 | Week 7-8 | First entity validation, begin core entity migration | Validated First Entity, Core Entity Pipeline Started |
| Sprint 5 | Week 9-10 | Complete core entity migration (Sites, Employees), begin secondary entities | Core Entity Pipelines, Enhanced Monitoring, Initial Operational Tools |
| Sprint 6 | Week 11-12 | Complete secondary entity migration (Floors, Neighborhoods, Greetly Visits) | Secondary Entity Pipelines, Operational Procedures |
| Sprint 7 | Week 13-14 | Complex entity migration (Desks, Desk Bookings, Desk Shifts) | Complex Entity Pipelines, Integration Testing |
| Sprint 8 | Week 15-16 | Final entity migration (Presence, Desk Moves), system integration | Complete Entity Migration, Final Integration, System Validation |

### 9.3.2 Acceleration Strategy

To accomplish the migration within 4 months, the following acceleration strategies will be implemented:

1. **Parallel Work Streams**:
   - Team A: Core infrastructure and first entity
   - Team B: Monitoring and operational tools
   - Team C: Secondary entity preparation

2. **Prioritized Entity Migration**:
   - Focus on highest-value entities first
   - Group similar entities for parallel implementation
   - Apply learnings from early migrations to accelerate later ones

3. **Simplified Initial Implementation**:
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Defer non-critical enhancements to post-migration
   - Implement minimum viable monitoring initially, enhance later

4. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Dedicated team without competing priorities
   - Front-loaded architecture and prototyping
   - Streamlined approval processes
   - Automated testing to accelerate validation

### 9.3.3 High-Level Timeline for All Four Phases

| Phase | Tentative Dates | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Project Phoenix | [Start] - [Start+4 months] | 4 months | Architecture, Entity Migration, System Integration |
| Phase 2: Streamline Data Migration | [Start+4 months] - [Start+7 months] | 3 months | New Entity Framework, Development Tools, Documentation |
| Phase 3: GraphQL API Integration | [Start+7 months] - [Start+11 months] | 4 months | GraphQL Schema, External Integration, Subscriptions |
| Phase 4: Apigee Replacement | [Start+11 months] - [Start+16 months] | 5 months | Federation Architecture, Unified API, Apigee Decommissioning |

### 9.3.4 Resource Allocation

To support the accelerated timeline, resources will be increased and focused:

1. **Engineering Resources**:
   - Technical Lead (100% allocation)
   - Senior Engineers (4-5 FTE, increased from 3-4)
   - QA Engineers (2 FTE, increased from 1-2)
   - DevOps Engineer (1.5 FTE, increased from 1)

2. **Operational Resources**:
   - Operations Lead (50% allocation increasing to 100% during deployment)
   - Support Engineers (1 FTE increasing to 2 FTE during deployment)

3. **Management Resources**:
   - Project Manager (100% allocation)
   - Product Owner (75% allocation, increased from 50%)
   - Technical Product Manager (75% allocation, increased from 50%)

### 9.3.5 Risk Mitigation for Accelerated Timeline

The accelerated timeline introduces additional risks that require specific mitigation:

1. **Quality Risks**:
   - Enhanced automated testing
   - Dedicated QA resources from day one
   - Regular quality gates and reviews

2. **Resource Burnout**:
   - Careful workload management
   - Cross-training to distribute knowledge
   - Buffer periods built into schedule

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Clear documentation of technical compromises
   - Scheduled refinement period after migration
   - Prioritized backlog of post-migration improvements

4. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Early integration testing
   - Mock interfaces for dependent components
   - Regular integration checkpoints

5. **Timeline Pressure**:
   - Weekly schedule reviews
   - Prioritization framework for features
   - Clear criteria for must-have vs. nice-to-have features
