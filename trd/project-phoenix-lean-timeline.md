# Lean Timeline for Project Phoenix (4-Month Schedule)

## 9.3 Timeline

### 9.3.1 Detailed Timeline for Project Phoenix

This 4-month timeline is designed for a lean implementation with a single development team of two developers, leveraging agentic tools to accelerate development and reduce manual effort.

| Sprint | Dates | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|--------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Sprint 1 | Week 1-2 | Architecture definition, planning, setup of agentic tools | TRD, Architecture Documentation, Agentic Tool Configuration |
| Sprint 2 | Week 3-4 | Technical prototyping, pipeline framework, code generation setup | Prototype Results, Pipeline Framework Templates, CI/CD Setup |
| Sprint 3 | Week 5-6 | First entity migration (Neighborhoods), monitoring framework | Initial Entity Pipeline, Monitoring Dashboard, Code Generation Patterns |
| Sprint 4 | Week 7-8 | Core entity migration (Sites), validation framework | Sites Pipeline, Automated Validation Framework |
| Sprint 5 | Week 9-10 | Core entity migration (Employees), automated testing expansion | Employees Pipeline, Expanded Test Coverage |
| Sprint 6 | Week 11-12 | Secondary entity migration (Floors, Greetly Visits) | Secondary Entity Pipelines, Operational Procedures |
| Sprint 7 | Week 13-14 | Complex entity migration (Desks, Desk Bookings) | Complex Entity Pipelines, Integration Testing |
| Sprint 8 | Week 15-16 | Final entity migration (Desk Shifts, Desk Moves, Presence) | Complete System, Final Integration, Validation |

### 9.3.2 Lean Development Strategy

With only two developers and a 4-month timeline, the following strategies will be implemented:

1. **Agentic Tool Utilization**:
   - AI-assisted code generation for repetitive pipeline components
   - Automated test generation based on specifications
   - AI-driven documentation generation
   - Intelligence-augmented debugging and problem solving

2. **Template-Based Development**:
   - Create robust entity pipeline templates early
   - Develop once, reuse across entities with configuration
   - Parameterized transformation logic
   - Standardized testing frameworks

3. **Progressive Entity Migration**:
   - Start with simplest entity to establish patterns
   - Apply learnings to accelerate subsequent migrations
   - Group similar entities to reuse code and patterns
   - Focus on one entity at a time for quality assurance

4. **Automated Quality Assurance**:
   - Extensive automated testing to compensate for limited QA resources
   - Auto-generated data consistency validation
   - Continuous integration with automated deployments
   - Monitoring-driven development approach

### 9.3.3 Agentic Tool Implementation

To maximize the productivity of the two-person team, the following agentic tools will be leveraged:

1. **Code Generation**:
   - AI-driven pipeline code generation from entity specifications
   - Automated transformation logic generation based on schema mappings
   - Test case generation from requirements

2. **Development Acceleration**:
   - AI pair programming assistance
   - Automated code review and optimization
   - Intelligent debugging assistance
   - Pattern recognition for solution reuse

3. **Infrastructure Automation**:
   - Infrastructure as code templates
   - Automated environment provisioning
   - Configuration generation
   - Deployment automation

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Management**:
   - Automated documentation generation
   - Knowledge extraction and organization
   - Searchable development context
   - Self-documenting code practices

### 9.3.4 High-Level Timeline for All Four Phases

| Phase | Tentative Dates | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Project Phoenix | [Start] - [Start+4 months] | 4 months | Architecture, Entity Migration, System Integration |
| Phase 2: Streamline Data Migration | [Start+4 months] - [Start+7 months] | 3 months | New Entity Framework, Development Tools |
| Phase 3: GraphQL API Integration | [Start+7 months] - [Start+11 months] | 4 months | GraphQL Schema, External Integration |
| Phase 4: Apigee Replacement | [Start+11 months] - [Start+16 months] | 5 months | Federation Architecture, Unified API |

### 9.3.5 Resource Allocation

The lean team structure consists of:

1. **Core Team**:
   - Senior Developer / Technical Lead (100% allocation)
   - Developer (100% allocation)

2. **Supporting Resources**:
   - Operations Support (25% allocation)
   - Product Owner / Project Manager (25% allocation)

3. **Agentic Augmentation**:
   - AI development assistants (continuous usage)
   - Automated testing tools (continuous usage)
   - Code generation frameworks (continuous usage)

### 9.3.6 Risk Mitigation for Lean Team

The small team size introduces specific risks that require targeted mitigation:

1. **Knowledge Concentration Risk**:
   - Comprehensive documentation from day one
   - Pair programming and knowledge sharing
   - Leveraging agentic tools for knowledge capture and transfer

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Strict prioritization of features
   - Focus on automation to multiply effectiveness
   - Clear MVP definition with phased enhancement approach

3. **Technical Complexity**:
   - Template-based approach to reduce unique code
   - Early architectural decisions to simplify implementation
   - Leverage managed services where possible to reduce operational burden

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Automated testing to compensate for limited manual testing
   - Continuous validation and monitoring
   - Incremental deployment with feature flags

5. **Timeline Pressure**:
   - Weekly progress assessment
   - Scope management with clear prioritization
   - Early identification of bottlenecks through daily standups
